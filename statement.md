The Fraud Safety System

This system acts like a smart security guard for your transactions. It has two simple jobs:

1. The Quick Check (Risk Score)

The system first takes a quick look at the customer's data about how much they are spending, how far away they are, and if they are new to get a gut feeling about the risk. It then gives the order a simple label: Extreme, Elevated, Medium, or Low.

2. The Final Decision (The Rules)

Next, the system checks the risk label against the payment method (like PayPal versus a Credit Card). It applies clear business rules to make the final, human-friendly decision:

Approve

Decline

Hold for Review (Ask a human to check it)

Challenge (Ask the customer for more security)

This two-step process makes sure every decision is fast, safe, and easy to explain.
