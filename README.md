The Fraud Brain: A Hybrid System That Knows When to Chill Out

Let's face it: running an e-commerce shop is tough. You have to stop the bad guys without accidentally ticking off your best customers. That's the tension this simple Python script is designed to resolve.

It's not some monolithic black box; it's a Hybrid AI System that thinks like a human team, splitting the work into two clear steps:

The Predictive Analyst (The "Gut Feeling"): This is the speed demon. It takes the cold, hard numbers—value, distance, history—and instantly assigns a raw risk score according to the Training of the Ai like (Extreme, Elevated, Medium, or Low).

The Legal & Business Expert (The "Final Call"): This is the cautious one. It takes the Analyst's score and says, "Wait, what's the payment method?" It applies non-negotiable business rules to decide the final action.

This approach gives us the speed of AI combined with the essential human element of reason and explainability.
